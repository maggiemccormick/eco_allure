McCormick senior capstone project for University of Redlands CS 450 course. 

One of the largest issues facing our modern world is climate change and environmental sustainability. This issue poses not just a threat to our current population, but also to the generations of the future. To make a difference, we as consumers have a responsibility to change our purchasing habits. Although much of the responsibility falls on governments and corporations to make large-scale changes, our buying habits and the demand we create for sustainable products are extremely influential. 
One of the best ways to change consumer habits is through education, specifically easily accessible and easily-understood facts and data. EcoAllure targets consumers who regularly purchase beauty products and provides them with information about the sustainability of these products. This includes things such as if the product is cruelty free, what specific ingredients are used in the product and the packaging, where the product is produced, and if the packaging can be recycled or turned back to the company for end-of-life reuse. For the sake of a short-term capstone project, I will only be focusing on a select amount of beauty brands and their competitors to build the first iteration of what could become a full platform over time.
